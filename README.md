<details align="center"><summary>Types of projects:</summary>

<div align="justify">

- *Technical assessment*: Projects created specifically for job interviews, coding challenges, or technical evaluations. These projects demonstrate technical proficiency, problem-solving abilities, and coding standards within defined constraints and evaluation criteria.
- *Educational*: Projects designed to teach or demonstrate specific concepts, technologies, or methodologies. These projects should come with detailed documentation and examples (but that's usually not always the case).
- *Personal*: Projects created for personal use or interests. These could be anything from hobby projects to tools you find useful in your day-to-day life.
- ⁠*Refresher*: Projects aimed at refreshing or updating knowledge and skills in a particular area. These can be simple exercises or comprehensive projects revisiting concepts already learned before.
- ⁠*Exploratory*: Projects that involve experimenting with new technologies, techniques, or ideas. These projects are typically more open-ended and focused on discovery and learning.
- *Professional*: Projects done for work or as part of your professional development. These could include client projects, portfolio pieces, or contributions to open source.
- ⁠*Collaborative*: Projects where multiple people are contributing. These can be open source projects, team projects, or any other type of collaborative effort.
- *Prototype*: Projects that are in an early stage of development. These are often used to test ideas and gather feedback before committing to a full-scale implementation.
- ⁠*Template*: Projects that serve as a starting point for other projects. These often include a basic setup and can be used as a blueprint for similar projects.
